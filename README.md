Recommendations: To enhance X Holdingsâ€™ security posture and ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information, multiple controls need to be implemented. Key controls include enforcing Least Privilege access, establishing disaster recovery plans, updating password policies, ensuring separation of duties, deploying an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), managing legacy systems, implementing encryption, and introducing a password management system. 

Additionally, to address compliance gaps, X Holdings should adopt controls such as Least Privilege, separation of duties, and encryption. The company also needs to classify assets effectively to identify any further controls necessary to strengthen its security posture and safeguard sensitive data.
